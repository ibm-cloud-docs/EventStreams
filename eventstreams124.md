# Managing access to your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources 
{: #security }

You can secure your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources in a fine-grained manner to manage the access that you want to grant each user to each resource.
{: shortdesc}

When you make changes to IAM policies and permissions, these can sometimes take several minutes to be reflected in the underlying service.
{: important}

## What can I secure?
{: #what_secure }

Within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, you can secure access to the following resources:
* Cluster (cluster): you can control which applications and users can connect to the service
* Topics (topic): you can control the ability of users and applications to create, delete, read, and write to a topic 
* Consumer groups (group): you can control an application's ability to join a consumer group 
* Producer transactions (txnid): you can control the ability to use the transactional producer capability in Kafka (that is, single, atomic writes across multiple partitions)

The levels of access (also known as a role) that you can assign to a user to each resource are as follows:

| Access role | Description of actions | Example actions |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|  Reader | Perform read-only actions within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} such as viewing resources | Allow an app to connect to a cluster by assigning read access to cluster resource type |
| Writer | Writers have permissions beyond the reader role, including editing {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources. | Allow an app to produce to topics by assigning write access to topic resource and topic name types|
| Manager | Managers have permissions beyond the writer role to complete privileged actions. In addition, you can create and edit {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources. | Allow full access to all resources by assigning manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance.

<br /> Allow administrative configuration on the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance, for example, mirroring topic selection.

<!-- comment from Charlie and my reply 
CM: need to confirm if hierarchical e.g. write includes read - and doc. 
KR: I think they do inherit the lower level access https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#iamusermanrol

## How do I assign access?
{: #assign_access }

Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are attached to the resources to be controlled. Each policy defines the level of access that a particular user should have and to which resource or set of resources. A policy consists of the following information: 
* The type of service the policy applies to. For example, {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. You can scope a policy to include all service types. 
* The instance of the service to be secured. You can scope a policy to include all instances of a service type. 
* The type of resource to be secured. The valid values are <code>cluster</code>, <code>topic</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>schema</code>, or <code>txnid</code>. Specifying a type is optional. If you do not specify a type, the policy then applies to all resources in the service instance.
If you want to specify more than one type of resource, you must create one policy per resource. 
* The resource to be secured. Specify for resources of type <code>topic</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>schema</code>, and <code>txnid</code>. If you do not specify the resource, the policy then applies to all resources of the type specified in the service instance. 
* The role assigned to the user. For example, Reader, Writer, or Manager. 

## What are the default security settings?
{: #default_settings }

By default, when {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} is provisioned, the user who provisioned it is granted the manager role to all the instance's resources. Additionally, any user who has a manager role for either 'All' services or 'All' {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service instances' in the same account also has full access. 

You can then apply additional policies to extend access to other users. You can either scope a policy to apply to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} as a whole or to individual resources within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. For more information, see [Common scenarios](#security_scenarios).

Only users with an administration role for an account can assign policies to users . Assign policies either by using IBM Cloud dashboard or by using the **ibmcloud** commands.

For more information about IAM, see 
[IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamoverview#iamoverview).

For an example of how to set policies, see: 
[IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs and API Keys ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-ibm-cloud-iam-service-ids-api-keys){:new_window}.

## Wildcarding
{: #wildcarding }
You can take advantage of the IAM wildcarding facility to set policies for groups of resources on {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. 
For example, if you give all your topics names like `Dept1_Topic1` and `Dept1_Topic2`, you can set policies for topics called `Dept1_*` and these policies will be applied to all topics with that prefix. For more information, see 
[Assigning access by using wildcard policies ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/iam?topic=iam-wildcard){:new_window}.

## Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
{: #connect_message_enterprise }

For information about how to bind a Cloud Foundry application or get a security key credential for an external application, see 
[Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-connecting).

## Managing access to the Schema Registry
{: #managing_access_schemas}

The authorization model for the Schema Registry used the same style of policies described in the [Managing Access To {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} Resources](#security) section of this document


### IAM Resources
{: #iam_resources}

With the new <code>schema</code> IAM resource type it is possible to create policies that control access using varying degrees of granularity, for example:

- a specific schema
- a set of schemas selected via a wildcard expression
- all of the schemas stored by an instance of IBM {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
- all of the schemas stored by all of the instances of IBM {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} in an account

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} already has the concept of a cluster resource type. This is used to control all access to the service instance,
with the minimum role of Reader being required to access any Kafka or HTTPS endpoint. This use of the cluster resource type will
also be applied to the schema registry whereby a minimum role of Reader will be required to access the registry.

### Example Authorization Scenarios
{: #example_authorization_scenarios}

The following table describes some examples of scenarios for interacting with the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} schema registry, together with the
roles which would be required by the actors involved. The process of managing schemas is handled separately to deploying applications. So policies are required for both the service ID that manages schemas in the registry and the application connecting to the registry

Scenario | Person or process role | Person or process resource| Application role | Application resource
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 New schema versions are placed into the registry by a person or process that is separate from the applications that use the schemas.| <code>Reader</code> <br /><code>Writer</code>| <code>cluster</code> <br /><code>schema</code> | <code>Reader</code> <br /><code>Reader</code> | <code>cluster</code> <br /><code>schema</code>
Adding a new schema to the registry needs to specify a non-default rule that controls how versions of the schema are allowed to evolve. |<code>Reader</code> <br /><code>Manager</code> | <code>cluster</code><br /><code>schema</code> | Not applicable |  Not applicable
Schemas are managed alongside the application code that uses the schema. New schema versions are created at the point an application tries to make use of the new schema version. | Not applicable | Not applicable | <code>Reader</code> <br /><code>Writer</code>| <code>cluster</code> <br /><code>schema</code>
The global default rule that controls schema evolution is changed. | <code>Manager</code> | <code>cluster</code> | Not applicable | Not applicable
