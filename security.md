## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
{: #pci_dss}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} completes annual PCI DSS assessments by using an approved Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), and the resulting Attestations of Compliance (AOCs) and Service Responsibility Matrix (SRM) guides are available upon customer request. Auditors reviewed {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} for compliance under PCI DSS version 3.2.1 at Service Provider Level 1.

{: tip}

Customers are responsible for the storing, processing, and transmission of their cardholder data, and can create cardholder data environments (CDEs) that can store, transmit, or process cardholder data by using {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. Customers can request and use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} AOCs and SRM guides when they seek their own PCI DSS certifications. It is the responsibility of the customer to document and operate CDEs and applications that are built by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform services in a PCI DSS-compliant manner.

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} documentation on service security and deletion of data covers methods to manage cardholder data within the environment in accordance with PCI requirements. It is the customer’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with these processes and to manage data retention and removal from the service according to the customer’s policies. To facilitate this process, no cardholder data can be used in an {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} document ID. If PAN data is to be stored in {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, they must be rendered unreadable (in accordance with PCI requirement 3.4) before transmission to the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service.

A full list of PCI DSS-ready {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform services, and options to request a PCI DSS AOC and SRM guide, can be found at the [IBM Cloud compliance page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance).

The Enterprise and Standard plans are PCI DSS certified.
