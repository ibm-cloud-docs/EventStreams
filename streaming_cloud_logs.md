# Streaming data from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}
{: #streaming_data_cloud_logs}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} can be used to stream data from {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} to other corporate tools, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.
{: shortdesc}

When you enable streaming on an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} instance, you configure {{site.data.keyword.logs_full}} to send data to an {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance. Then, you can configure Kafka Connect to consume the data and forward it to your destination tool. After the data is persisted within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, you can configure any application, or service to create a subscription and take action on log data that is streamed.
